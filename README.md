# recruting_project
A simple C++ project corresponding to a recruting test :


## Aim of the project to develop

Devlop a console application enabling to manage a library containing Books, Comics, and their authors.

Expected application behaviour :

From input in the console, it will be possible to:
- Add a book
- Add an author
- Search for a books' author,
- Search for book(s) from an author
 

## Test setup

duration
- creating the project should take around ~1h30

- bonus 
* use of classes (Object Oriented Programming)
* use Singleton
* use of pointers
* use of lambda functions if relevant
* architecture : MVC or MVVM pattern design
* use attributs

Deliverable
- the source code alone was to be delivered, not the executable.

## Note on the proposed project sample
This proposed project does not provided library data persistency, so you have to enter books and authors each time you launch that application, to test it.

## Generating the project of the project
- Assuming you'll use *CMake* to generate the project, the required *CMakeLists.txt* are provided (simply point to the top project one with CMake).
- Follow the 3 simple steps from provided *README_HOW_TO_GENERATE_PROJECT.txt* file to get ready to build and get the library binary.
